The idea behind this project is to get a red, a green and a blue laser and clock them using invisible
red LED pair along with the bouncing of reflective LED pair to achieve a single pixel in a glass cube.


How I see it is the invisible red emitter and receiver will travel the over all transmission time, and
because it's triggered by red laser light some then can be used as a voice around and outside of a red
laser, for the green and blue, as well, the green be a line type of laser, then the rate in hertz of
flickering RGS against each other with intensities, is how the blue gets around voice to the all will
when opaque in glass, cause reflective LED pairs to bounce off, or a somehow smoky glass only on light
that can reflect, I've still only setup a laser and invisible red, and reflective like in the project.
