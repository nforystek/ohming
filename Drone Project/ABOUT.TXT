Initially I called this project YAADD, "Yet Another Arduino Dumb Drone,"  I haven't seen a first so "another" is misleading, but I assume with all those out there, largely drone and Arduino markets may somehow depend on each other.  This is my Drone Project folder that I will update as a work in progress of SketchUp models for 3D printing, wiring diagrams, and software code for both sketches and the ESP8299 Basic langauge.

Apart from the files, or software, everything else is purchasable via Amazon.com where I myself acquire anything referenced in making project. 3D filament, an inexpensive 3D printer, Arduino's, or modules/hardware that interfaces to an Arduino are all 100% purchased through Amazon.com and quite cheap I believe for end user, but I'm not sure where else to get such electronics.

               MY DRONE:
#########################################


I am not making a functional camera, but there will be four available onboard PWM pins left or 8 binary on/off’s depending on how it pans out, and the weight of the unit currently is nearing half the weight of a very cheap 30$ one I got on Amazon that does have a camera.

I am going with a separate hand held unit not a phone or computer as the controls, as to make it just a neat toy that hopefully flies comprised of the two pieces, a drone and controller, and charges with a computer or charger chord.  The controller will be a small similarity to that of Sega Genesis built up with InstaMorph plastic.

               PROGRESS:

I’ve only recently got operating with all connected elements and modules of both the drone and a remote control on breadboards. The next part of the process is thoroughly documenting in diagram so I can recreate it no questions in a permanent unit, with out ordering a whole set of extra parts to built one along side, and so I made this folder to share with the public.

               OUTLOOK:
#########################################


I am not trying to put too much money into this, otherwise I get discouraged, but the effort in 3D modeling and programming has been thus far my kind of expensive fun, that I may do in versed with SketchUp 3D and a number of computer languages.

To the quest, there are so many thousands of these things it seems you can find around today, cheap to expensive, and I’m just trying to enjoy seeing one get up in flight, I love electronics, you can see my hobby experience by searching for “nforystek” on the EveryCircuit.com.
