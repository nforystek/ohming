Implements can be confusing but if taken from a C++ stand point on what interface and inheirtance concepts are genreally supposed to do for the programmer it still isn't clear in VB6!  So I wrote these examples, in many ways VB6 has the NOS of cover-alls, but it maybe is more bogus then pratical, there also is some disadvantages with the envrionment was never updated again, and deeply using Implements you might have run into these errors, one these probject solve is by using an API call in Intitalize directly to the Virtual Machine DLL.
